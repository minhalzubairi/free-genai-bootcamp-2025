    Possible Sentence Structure
    Verb (Existence/Location) + Subject (Cats) + Prepositional Phrase (at the door)
    Question Particle + Verb (Leave) + Object (Garbage) + Adverb (Out)
    
    Clues
    Think about the verb that describes the existence or location of the cats. Is it كُنَّ (kunn) or another verb?
    How would you form the plural of قِطٌّ (qiṭ̣)?
    What preposition would you use to indicate the location "at the door"?
    How would you form a question using the verb تَرَكَ (taraka)?
    Think about the word order and how to connect the ideas in the sentence.
    Work through these clues, and see if you can construct the sentence in Arabic!
